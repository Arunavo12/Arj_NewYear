        Some people become family without sharing blood. This is for one of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy New Year bro. It’s honestly been such a long year, one of those years where you don’t even realise how much has happened until you sit down and really think about it. It’s funny because you never go into a year expecting to get closer to people in the way you do. It just happens naturally, quietly, without you noticing. So let me just start with this, because there’s no other way to put it. You are my younger brother. No debating it, no technicalities. That’s just what you are to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love you more than you could probably ever know or fully realise, and even actions don’t always do justice to it. There are some things you feel that you just can’t always express properly and this is one of those things. This year’s been hectic in the best and worst ways, from the concert to football to random nights out drinking to Durga Puja, Kali Puja, and everything else in between. When I look back at it all, it’s crazy how naturally you’re part of almost every important moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        What’s really interesting to me is how, in my eyes, you went from being this incredibly sorted, put together, almost perfect guy to someone who is just like the rest of us, but not weaker for it. If anything, stronger. Stronger because you carry things quietly, stronger because you keep yourself going even when it’s hard, and stronger because you choose to stay stable and okay when it would be easier not to.
      </p>

      <p>
        I appreciate how hard you work to keep yourself stable and okay, but I appreciate you even more for trusting me with your problems, your worries, and your issues. That trust genuinely means more to me than you probably realise.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we had our little football scuffle and then the concert just two days later, what upset me wasn’t the argument itself. It was the fact that I had a fight with someone I consider family. That was the moment I realised how deep that bond really is.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s funny how despite being four years younger, I feel closer to you than to someone who is my own age, even your own brother, and that’s not me saying anything bad about him. I just have this unique love and care for you, especially because you’re younger, and it’s not something I can replace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when we’re joking around, I always notice how you never cross certain lines or make things disrespectful. You understand that despite the banter, there’s a level of respect that stays intact, and that makes me appreciate you even more.
      </p>

      <p>
        When everything happened with Nibin and you referred to me as your older brother, it genuinely stayed with me. Being an only child, I won’t ever have that kind of bond through blood, so when someone chooses me as family, it means more than I can explain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even at football, when someone hurts you or goes in on you, the way I react isn’t thought out. It’s instinct. It’s the same response I’d have if someone went after my own family.
      </p>

      <p>
        I trust you bro, with my issues, with my secrets, with the parts of me I don’t show everyone, and I hope you know you can do the same with me. You’re one of the kindest and most caring people I know, sometimes too caring, and that’s why you end up getting hurt. I think that’s exactly what we bond over. Caring too much and not always having people to look out for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I know that even if the whole world was against me, you’d still be there, and that kind of love and loyalty is rare. So thank you for being you. Thank you for being there when I need you. Thank you for being a player on our team. Thank you for being an amazing friend, and an even more amazing brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope we go out more, laugh more, and enjoy life even more. Here’s to a happier, lighter, and less depressed 2026.
      </p>

        Always your brother.<br />
